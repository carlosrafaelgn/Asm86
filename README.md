Asm86
=====

This is a JavaScript assembly x86 compiler and emulator for educational purposes. I use it in my classes on Computer Architecture.

The project site, [carlosrafaelgn.com.br/Asm86](https://carlosrafaelgn.com.br/Asm86), can be used as an example (in English). It uses [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net) as the code editor.

The script adds only three names to the global namespace: Asm86EmulatorContext, Asm86EmulatorCompiler and Asm86Emulator. However, creating instances of Asm86EmulatorContext and Asm86EmulatorCompiler will not be so usefull.

Asm86Language.js adds translation support and consumes two more names from the global namespace: Asm86Language and Asm86UI. Although the example is in English, the script's default language is Portuguese.

Limitations:
- Not all instructions have been implemented
- Not all flags have been implemented
- No segment/paging support
- Only 9 registers available (debug and control registers are not available)
- No task support as nowadays OSes implement (simple tasks can still be created using time-sharing algorithms)
- IO ports do not reflect the standard IO ports available in PC's
- No float point/MMX/SSE... instructions
- No advanced features like GDT, LDT
- IDT support is limited and does not reflect the original IDT description
- Instructions XSAVE and XRSTOR were changed and do not reflect the documented version
- Interrupts < 32, except for int 3, are not supported
- No instructions modifiers/prefixes, other than REP, have been implemented
- No 3 or more operands instructions have been implemented
- Not all CMOVcc/Jcc/SETcc instructions have been implemented
- Neither protected mode nor virtual mode has been implemented

I tried to be as faithful as possible to the manuals from Intel (although Volumes 2C, 3A, 3B and 3C were not too much used):
